# bunchcomputing

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of bunchcomputing is to compute summary statistics(means,median) on every columns in the dataframe.

## Installation

bunchcomputing is not yet on CRAN. But, you can download it from this repository using the following R command:

``` r
install.packages("bunchcomputing")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("WYC401/WYC_function")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bunchcomputing)
mean_all_numeric_variables(data.frame(data_1=c(1,2,3),data_2=c(0.2,0.4,0.4)))

## basic example code
```

The package is special because it can ignore the non-numeric columns.
```{r}
mean_all_numeric_variables(data.frame(data_1=c(“a”,"b","c"),data_2=c(0.2,0.4,0.4)))
```
